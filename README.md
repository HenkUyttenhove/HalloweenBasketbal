# HalloweenBasketbal
This is a basketbalgame based upon a Raspberry PI with two controls.

One control will trigger the start/stop of the clock while the second control is connected to a make contact mounted to the ring.  When a ball goes through the hoop, the counter will go up.

The purpose of the game is to score 5 balls through the hoop within 30 seconds.

When the game starts, you get a chopped head.  When you score a scream and when 5 points within 30 seconds a weerwolf. When timer is up without 5 points, you get a saw.
